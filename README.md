# Sourcery

## Where does your food come from?

When you buy an "organic" piece of fruit, what does that really mean? If you wanted to get in touch with the people who produced it and learn more about the product, would you know how to reach them? If you found a coffee bean you couldn't get enough of, would you know how to find more when the grocery store runs out?

There are countless reasons consumers might want to trace the path backwards from table to farm. There are even more reasons why a regulator might want to use a streamlined technology to easily investigate the origins of any agricultural product, even if it's an individual fruit. This app provides an easy and trustworthy way to do that.

### How do I use it?

This repository is the collection of smart contracts (written in Solidity, using the Ethereum blockchain) that power our origin tracking application. As a user, your internet browser will interact with our [React front end](https://github.com/tmikeschu/sourcery-client) which is backed by a [Rails API](https://github.com/DavidKnott/sourcery-api) to minimize data storage on the blockchain. You'll want to check out our [production site](https://sourcery-client.herokuapp.com), and if you're a developer, check out the "Getting Started" section below.

### Glossary

Here's a guide to what we mean when we say words:

* **Lot**: A lot is a particular shipment of a given product. It might be a ton of coffee, cases of wine, or a pallet of diamonds. Whatever the product, a lot is its smallest unit.

* **Product**: Products are exactly what you think they are - coffee, wine or diamonds in the above examples.

* **Path**: A path is the series of steps between a customer and the lot's point of origin. If the wine originated in San Luis Obisbo, CA traveled to Salt Lake City, UT before arriving in Denver, CO the checkpoints would be those addresses in California, Utah and Colorado. In developer terms, it's an array of checkpoints. Each path is a unique contract generated by the PathsController.

* **Checkpoint**: Each step in a path is a checkpoint. It represents a physical location — most likely a store or producer — and can be pinpointed on a map by referencing the location data stored in the Rails API. In the example above, a street address in each of the cities is a checkpoint.

### Getting Started

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/ethanbennett/sourcery.git

// Install dependencies:
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g testrpc

// Run the tests:
testrpc // Let this run in a separate terminal session
truffle test

// Migrate the contracts:
truffle migrate
```
If this is your first time working with this language or framework, you might want to reference the [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) or [Truffle](https://truffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation. Solidity sytax highlighting is available for most text editors.

### About Us

We are a group of four [Turing School](https://www.turing.io/) students, and this is our capstone
project for the back-end engineering program. You can learn more about our
