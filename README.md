# Sourcery

## Where does your food come from?

When you buy an "organic" piece of fruit, what does that really mean? If you wanted to get in touch with the people who produced it and learn more about the product, would you know how to reach them? If you found a coffee bean you couldn't get enough of, would you know how to find more when the grocery store runs out?

There are countless reasons consumers might want to trace the path backwards from table to farm. There are even more reasons why a regulator might want to use a streamlined technology to easily investigate the origins of any agricultural product, even if it's an individual fruit. This app provides an easy and trustworthy way to do that, no matter what you need to use it for.

### How do I use it?

This repository is the collection of smart contracts (written in Solidity) that power our origin tracking application. It also has a [React front end](https://github.com/tmikeschu/sourcery-client) and a [Rails API](https://github.com/DavidKnott/sourcery-api) to minimize data storage on the blockchain. As a user, you'll want to check out our [production site](sourcery-client.herokuapp.com), and if you're a developer, check out the "Getting Started" section below.

### Glossary

Here's a guide to what we mean when we say words:

* **Lot**: A lot is a particular shipment of a given product. It might be a bag of coffee, a case of wine, or a pallet of diamonds. Whatever the product, a lot is its smallest unit.

* **Product**: Products are names and/or descriptions, primarily used to improve the user experience. Each lot is a product: if we're talking about cases of wine, each case is a separate lot and wine is the product.

* **Path**: A path is a series of steps between a customer and the lot's point of origin. In developer terms, it's an array of checkpoints. Each path is a unique contract generated by the PathsController.

* **Checkpoint**: Each step in a path is a checkpoint. It represents a physical location — most likely a store or producer — and can be pinpointed on a map by referencing the location data stored in the Rails API.

* **Location**: Locations are checkpoints, but in future releases, they'll provide a layer of security for checkpoint creation. Similar to standard authentication strategies, a location will only be able to add a checkpoint (receive or send a lot) if they actually possess the lot in the first place.

### Getting Started
